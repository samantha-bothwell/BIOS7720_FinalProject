## BIOS 7720 Final Project

Final project for Functional Data Analysis. This project uses physical activity collected by the NETHEALTH project at the University of Notre Dame. This project analyzes the following aims: 

- Aim 1:  Investigate the association between student college and physical activity levels using FoSR. 
- Aim 2: Investigate the association between student sleep and physical activity levels using FoFR. In particular, does previous night’s sleep impact next day’s activity?
